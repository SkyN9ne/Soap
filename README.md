Soap is a PowerShell module with system hardening, log analysis, and incident response functions. For a list of functions included, see [Functions](/Docs/Functions.md). For examples, see [Examples](/Docs/Examples.md). FYI, this repository also contains a few PowerShell [Scripts](/Scripts/). I plan to merge these scripts into the main Soap module in the future. To install Soap, enter the command below into an elevated PowerShell session.

```pwsh
Install-Module -Name Soap -Force
```
