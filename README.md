Soap is a PowerShell module with cybersecurity-related functions. For a list of functions included, see [Functions](/Docs/Functions.md). For examples, see [Examples](/Docs/Examples.md). FYI, this repository also contains a few PowerShell [Scripts](/Scripts/). I plan to merge these scripts into the Soap module in the future. To install Soap, enter the command below into an elevated PowerShell session.

```pwsh
Install-Module -Name Soap
```
