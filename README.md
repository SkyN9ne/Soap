Soap is a PowerShell module with cybersecurity-related functions. For a list of functions included in this module, see [Functions](/Docs/Functions.md). For some examples, see [Examples](/Docs/Examples.md). FYI, this repository also contains a few PowerShell scripts (see [Scripts](/Scripts/)). I plan to merge these scripts into the Soap in the future. To install the Soap, enter the command below into an elevated PowerShell session.

```pwsh
Install-Module -Name Soap
```
