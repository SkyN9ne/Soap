## Soap
![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/cyberphor/soap)  
Soap is a PowerShell module with cybersecurity-related functions. For a list of the functions included in this module, [read the doc](/Docs/Functions.md). FYI, this repository also contains a few PowerShell scripts. I plan to merge these scripts into the Soap in the future. To install the Soap, enter the command below into an elevated PowerShell session.

```pwsh
Install-Module -Name Soap
```
